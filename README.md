# Student-Management-Details
Tried to create Student Management System.
I gave more focus on the functionality part rather than UI. All the data from the user is getting added to local storage as database and showed the details on to the
dashboard.
There should be a navbar on every page where the number of students batch wise should be displayed in real time.
There is also a remove button to remove student data from the database as well as DOM, also have given some basic functionality like storing removed data in the key trash
in local storage & counting the no of students in different courses like web15, web16 and web17.
